###Lightning Talk Outline - Apple v. FBI

##Overview/Timeline
* Shooting 12/2/15
* Obtained and executed warrant 12/3/15
* Phone owned by employer, San Bernardino Co. Dept. of Public Health
* Apple provided data in its possession
* FBI sought Apple's assistance in accessing San Bernardino shooter's phone
* 2/16 Ex parte motion under the all writs act for order compelling assistance
* 2/16 order issued order compelling assistance
* Public statements from Apple, no filings
* 2/19 motion to compel
* 2/25 Apple motion to vacate and opposition to motion to compel


##Government's Argument
* Unable to complete search because of the iPhone's encrypted content. Apple has the exclusive technical means to assist govt but has declined.
* May contain communications between Farook and Malik re: plan, where they may have traveled to and from before and after the incident, and other pertinent info. Communications with Malik and victims.
* Government sought an order requiring Apple to develop software to disable the 10 strikes feature; also the time delay between failed attempts ("non-encryption features")
* Government stressed that its request applied to only this particular phone

##Court Order
* Directed Apple to provide “reasonable technical assistance to assist law enforcement agents in obtaining access to the data” on the device.
* Defined this assistance to include creating custom software

##Apple's Argument
* Apple characterized the order as requiring it to create a back door to defeat the encryption on the iPhone, leaving users' data vulnerable to thieves, hackers, etc.
* Emphasized lack of explicit statutory authority and burden of the court's order
* Apple argued that compelling it to develop software amounted to compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment
* Several amicus briefs were filed in support of Apple, including one from Amazon, Box, Cisco, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Snapchat, Slack, Yahoo  

#### Apple's communication to customers 2/17:

* "Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help [the FBI]. But now the US government has asked us for something we do not have, and something we consider it too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone."

* "In today's digital world, the "key" to an encrypted system is a piece of information that unlocks the data, and it is only as secure as the protections around it. Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge."

* "We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. For years, cryptologist and security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. Doing so would only hurt the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data. Criminals and bad actors will still encrypt, using tools that are readily available to them."

##Outcome
* Dropped after the government found a third party to develop the desired feature.

##Technology at Issue
* iPhone 5c
* iOS 9 encrypts the data files with 2 components: one user-determined password, and one unique 256-bit advanced encryption (AES) key, fused into the phone itself during manufacturing process. Both required for the OS to decrypt the phone's data files.
* Subject of the motion: the auto-erase function that wipes the device after 10 unsuccessful attempts at the passcode
* iCloud backups - most recent was 10/19/15
* Employer control features

##Other Cases/Broader Implications
* Use of encryption continues to increase
* Many other cases that present similar situation
