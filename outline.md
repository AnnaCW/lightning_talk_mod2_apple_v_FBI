###Lightning Talk Outline - Apple v. FBI

##Overview
* FBI sought Apple's assistance in accessing San Bernardino shooter's phone
* Obtained a warrant
* Filed an application and motion to compel
* Court granted the motion to compel

##Government's Argument
* Government sought an order requiring Apple to develop software to disable the 10 strikes feature
* Government stressed that its request applied to only this particular phone

##Court Order
* Directed Apple to provide “reasonable technical assistance to assist law enforcement agents in obtaining access to the data” on the device.
* Defined this assistance to include creating custom software

##Apple's Argument
* Apple characterized the order as requiring it to create a back door to defeat the encryption on the iPhone, leaving users' data vulnerable to thieves, hackers, etc.
* Emphasized lack of explicit statutory authority and burden of the court's order
* Apple argued that compelling it to develop software amounted to compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment

##Outcome
* Government dropped the case after finding a third party to develop the desired feature

##Technology at Issue
* Encrypted data on phone
* iPhone feature that wipes phone after 10 unsuccessful password attempts
* iCloud backups
* Employer control features

##Other Cases/Broader Implications
* Use of encryption continues to increase
* Many other cases that present similar situation
